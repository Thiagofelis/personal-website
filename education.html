  <h2>Education and my interests</h2>
  
  <p>At 2016 I was admitted at the Federal University of Minas Gerais to the electric engineering course. </p>
  
  <p>Some years ago I used to be a member of a progressive rock band, from which I split since I moved to France. We released the album <b>The Awakening Barrier</b> in which I play the keyboards and that contains some compositions of mine. If you have Spotify, you can listen to it <a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/1xLqBhxKCJoQGQGpYcFkZa?si=VcYQ3JkmTLOuiFBsLL7mQA">here</a>.</p>

  <p>Many years ago I used to produce electronic music, which was my first experience in composing music. If you want to take a look at what I done, you can listen to it <a href="https://soundcloud.com/felis-2">here</a>. Looking back at those tracks, many of them (specially the first ones) are very bad, but there are a few that I still think that are good ones and that I sometimes enjoy listening to.</p>

  <p>Nowadays I'm mainly working on my piano skills and learning to play classical music. I'm also taking a course on counterpoint writing.</p>
