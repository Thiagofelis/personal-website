<h2>My relationship with music</h2>
<p>My music interests range from progressive rock and jazz to classical and even electronic music.</p>

<p>Some years ago I used to be a member of a progressive rock band, from which I split since I moved to France. We released the album <b>The Awakening Barrier</b> in which I play the keyboards and that contains some compositions of mine. If you have Spotify, you can listen to it <a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/1xLqBhxKCJoQGQGpYcFkZa?si=VcYQ3JkmTLOuiFBsLL7mQA">here</a>.</p>

<p>Many years ago I used to produce electronic music, which was my first experience in composing music. If you want to take a look at what I done, you can listen to it <a href="https://soundcloud.com/felis-2">here</a>. Looking back at those tracks, many of them (specially the first ones) are very bad, but there are a few that I still think that are good ones and that I sometimes enjoy listening to.</p>

<p>Nowadays I'm mainly working on my piano skills and learning to play classical music. I'm also taking a course on counterpoint writing.</p>
